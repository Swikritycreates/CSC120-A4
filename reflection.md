- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It allows the concept of transparency and opacity in real world usage. We become concsious about what can be
presented in front of others and what don't need to.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Going through all the instructions step by step worked. However, when it came to connecting everything, I couldn't figure out and faced lots of bugs, specially in the loops.
