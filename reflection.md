- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It allows the concept of transparency and opacity in real world usage. We become concsious about what can be
presented in front of others and what don't need to.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I feel like I need better preperation to go through this course. Maybe it would've been better if I'd taken 110 first since it had been a while that I hadn't pursued coding. Better late realisation than never I guess? I've filled a course drop form. I hope to see you guys next year when i rejoin.
